# funtime-with-php-unittesting
Just decided to play around with PHP unittesting. Although I don't think I'll be doing much more here, TDD is definitely gonna become an integral part of my development process

So TDD(Test Driven Development) is a paradigm of writing code where the developer first writes an automated test for the code before writing the actual code.
 It allows him know in future if any code is broken in a part of the codebase because of any changes made to other parts of it.
 So this is me testing out TDD with PHP, I do have some experience with it in JavaScript and Python, but PHP is my girlfriend(for now though)
 and I just wanna make sure I know stuff about her that I know about other girls also....if you know what I mean(I really hope you do :)
